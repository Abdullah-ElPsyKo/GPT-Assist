# GPT-Assist
Gpt-Assist is a C# tool with a user-friendly GUI that allows users to easily manage and manipulate the contents of their clipboard with the help of ChatGPT. 

To use this program, you will need to obtain your own API key and insert it into the appropriate location in the code. Specifically, you should put your API key in the class1.cs file, where it is used to make requests to the API.

Please note that to run this program, you will need to have a specific package installed in your environment. The package is called Betalgo.OpenAI.GPT3 and it is required for the program to function properly.

## Note: Code Output Formatting

Please note that the code output provided by this app may not be perfectly formatted. In some cases, the output may appear on a single line without proper indentation or formatting. This project was developed as a small personal project to gain experience in creating an application with a graphical user interface (GUI). As such, I have decided to leave the app in its current state without further modifications to the code formatting.
